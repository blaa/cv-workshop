Computer vision workshop
========================

1. You need at least a computer with Python and OpenCV installed. It worked on
   Mac OS X, Windows with Anaconda and of course runs on Linux (python3-opencv
   package being only dependency on Debian).
2. For full workshop you need an USB camera, raspberry PI (version 2 or 3 preferred),
   and a servo. Something to do a ramp and colorful balls (glass ones for example).

3. Contents:
  - template.py contains initial template for participants to move boilerplate aside.
  - qlqi.py contains working algorithm that can be explained in around ~4h.
  - example.webm - highly compressed test video of balls going down the ramp.
